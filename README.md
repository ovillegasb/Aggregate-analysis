# Aggregate-analysis

*Orlando Villegas* 

Tools and routines implemented in Python to analyze aggregates in systems generated by GROMACS. Tools developed during the PhD studies.

## `aggregate.py`

Program that performs different analyses to aggregates contained in a system. It takes as main
input files the file to detect the topology a .gro and as trajectory .xtc, .trr or .gro. Here 4
files are generated in the execution directory: angles_pairs.dat, cluster_resid.dat, clusters.dat
and nclusters.dat.

Example:

```
python aggregates.py -s confout.gro -f traj_comp.xtc -i 5 -r 0.35 -n 1 -nmol 20
```

## `frame.py`

This program extracts the coordinates of the smallest and largest aggregates by number of molecules
for each selected frame. The file "cluster_resid.dat" and "clusters.dat" generated by aggregate.py
must be in the run folder. Two types of files are generated here, the first one frames.dat
indicates the residues of the largest and smallest aggregates per frame. The second type are .gro
files with the obtained aggregates. The following format is used: aggr[frame]_[nmol]_[index].gro.

Example:

```
python frames.py -s confout.gro -f traj_comp.xtc -n 20
```
